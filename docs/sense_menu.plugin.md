# Idilia Sense Menu

The Sense Menu jQuery plugin enables word sense selection in a web application. The possible senses are presented using visually appealing tiles which allow a user to quickly specify a specific word sense. Tiles can be presented in both a carousel or in a grid view. Both views are responsive and ajust the number of displayed tiles based on the screen width.
